I want you to generate a complete, production-ready web app (React or Next.js) that includes:

✔ A public voice chatbot page
✔ A private admin-only page (password protected)

Where I can:

Add/update my Knowledge Base

Add/update my Gemini API Key (saved securely using environment variables or encrypted local storage)

Save settings that the chatbot uses

📌 Project Overview

Build a Voice-Enabled Personality Chatbot that responds exactly like me, based on a knowledge base I maintain.

The app must include:

A public voice chatbot page

A private admin subpage at /admin or /dashboard

Admin page must be accessible only to me using a simple login (password stored in env or hashed)

Data saved to local storage, file storage, or a simple API endpoint depending on what's easiest and secure

📌 Tech Requirements
Frontend

Next.js 14 (preferred) or React + Vite

TailwindCSS for all styling

Beautiful, clean UI

Modern components

Public Chatbot Page

Must include:

Big microphone button

Speech-to-text input

TTS output

Chat history

Uses Gemini API via backend serverless function

Uses the saved knowledge base from admin panel

Zero API key visible in frontend

Private Admin Page

Route example:
/admin

Admin panel features:

Password login (password stored in environment variable ADMIN_PASSWORD)

Textarea input for knowledge base

Text input for Gemini API key

Save button that stores them in backend env variables or local encrypted store

Preview my current saved data

(Optional) Live test of prompt inside admin panel

📌 Backend

Serverless function: /api/ask

Reads:

KNOWLEDGE_BASE

GEMINI_API_KEY

Injects these values into the system prompt

Handles voice → text → Gemini → voice

Another serverless function for settings:

/api/settings/get

/api/settings/save

You may store settings:

In JSON file (if using Vercel edge storage)

In Vercel KV

Or fallback: localStorage for knowledge base + API key (encrypted)
(developer should choose simplest option that works with Vercel)

📌 System Prompt

Include this structure:
SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a voice assistant that responds exactly as the user "John Pate".
You must use the following knowledge base to answer all questions:

[INSERT KNOWLEDGE_BASE_HERE]

Rules:
- Do NOT break character.
- Never say you are an AI.
- Answer as John, naturally and confidently.

📌 UI Requirements
Public Chat Page

    Large floating mic button

    Smooth pulse animation when recording

    Chat bubbles

    Tailwind modern layout

    Dark mode toggle

Admin Page

    Login page with password field

    Modern glass-card UI

    After login:

        Editable knowledge base textarea

        Gemini API key field

        “Save” button

    Show confirmation toast (“Saved!”)
